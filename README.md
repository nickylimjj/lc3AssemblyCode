# lc3AssemblyCode
Collection of stock LC3 assembly code

A bunch of LC3 code I wrote either from class or my own.

you can get the code by entering the following command:
  cd
  git clone https://github.com/nickylimjj/lc3AssemblyCode.git

You will see a new folder 'lc3AssemblyCode' in your home folder.

Cheers!
